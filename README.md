# Blinkit Analytics Project – From Data to Insights

I’m excited to share my latest exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on Blinkit, a fast-growing instant grocery delivery platform.

Project Summary:

Performed detailed analysis of Blinkit’s order and customer behavior data

Uncovered insights on high-performing cities, peak delivery times, and category trends

Created impactful visualizations to communicate data-driven observations

Key Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

Top Insights:

Evenings (especially 6–10 PM) are peak hours for order placement

Cities like Bangalore and Delhi NCR show highest order volumes

Most popular categories include fruits & vegetables and dairy products

This project sharpened my skills in:

Data wrangling and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis and visualization

Interpreting data in a business context
